Just like that

Its a 10 min repo. :)

Written according to my mac terminal name convention.

Someone actually sat on my mac and started to type something on terminal but he wasn't able to. It looked so natural in compared to other open terminal tabs on my machine taht he didn't think of this as some program running. He tried CTRL+C but even that didn't work. I was laughing :D Finally he did CTRL+Z :( Didn't trap that.

But it was funny!
